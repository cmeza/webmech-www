      PHP using Slim 2.6 microservices MVC framework for a REST API. External assets managed with Composer, including a
      CORS middleware for Slim. The resume object was kept simple as a static JSON object. Some of the future features
      I'd like to add to the site would require a database and I will use MySQL or MariaDB.
